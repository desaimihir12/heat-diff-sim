# heat-diff-sim
This is the repository for the lab 9 of the course CS302 Modelling and Simulation offered in Winter 2021 at DA-IICT. The objective of the lab is to model the heat diffusion problem in a thin metal bar, to which constant cold and hot temperatures at fixed points on its surface are applied.
* Course - CS302 Modelling and Simulation
* Instructor - Prof. Mukesh Tiwari
* The Team - Mihir Desai (201801033) and Prayush Dave (201801021)
## File structure
* heat-diff-model.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for the model and implementations of the Project 1-4 from Module 10.2 from the textbook<sup>1</sup>.
* heat-diff-driver.ipynb - Notebook to run the custom test case for the heat diffusion of metal rod problem. Click on this colab link to use the code.
* anim1.mp4 - Video of the first simulation of the problem.
## Instructions to run the code
