# heat-diff-sim
This is the repository for the lab 9 of the course CS302 Modelling and Simulation offered in Winter 2021 at DA-IICT. The objective of the lab is to model the heat diffusion problem in a thin metal bar, to which constant cold and hot temperatures at fixed points on its surface are applied.
* Course - CS302 Modelling and Simulation
* Instructor - Prof. Mukesh Tiwari
* The Team - Mihir Desai (201801033) and Prayush Dave (201801021)
## File structure
* model.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for the model and implementations of the Project 1-4 and 9 from Module 10.2 from the textbook<sup>1</sup>.
* animations-guide - Text file which contains the descriptions of the animation videos of the simulations performed with inital conditions and the cases. All the videos are titled `anim-<number>`.
* Files titled `plot<number>` are the plots from the implementations saved.
## Instructions to access the notebook
* model.ipynb contains the implementations in jupyter notebook. [Click here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yvBlmYkPWOhG7639NSUGqHYCwR8e6KmB?usp=sharing) for the colab link for the same notebook uploaded there, if in any case the .ipynb is not accessible.
